                Hello there! My name is Kiril Valkov and I am a front-end web developer. My journey into the world of Web development began with intensive specialized courses at Softuni, where I took the JS Web Development path. Throughout the courses, I consistently achieved excellent scores. As a result, I have become proficient in a range of technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML & CSS, Material UI, Redux Toolkit, Angular, Node.js, MongoDB and more.
